# ðŸ“‚ Bit Manipulation - Working with Bits  

## **ðŸ“Œ What Is Bit Manipulation?**  
Bit Manipulation is the process of **directly modifying binary representations** of numbers.  
It is used for **efficient computations** (O(1) operations).  

### **âœ… Common Bitwise Operators**
| Operator | Symbol | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| AND | `&` | `5 & 3 = 1` |
| OR | &#124; &#124; | `5 &#124; 3 = 7` |
| XOR | `^` | `5 ^ 3 = 6` |
| Left Shift | `<<` | `5 << 1 = 10` |
| Right Shift | `>>` | `5 >> 1 = 2` |
