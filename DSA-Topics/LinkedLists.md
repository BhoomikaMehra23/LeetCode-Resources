# ðŸ“‚ Linked Lists - Traversal & Manipulation  

## **ðŸ“Œ What Are Linked Lists?**  
A **linked list** is a linear data structure in which elements (nodes) are **linked using pointers**.  
It can be **Singly Linked List (SLL), Doubly Linked List (DLL), or Circular Linked List**.  

### **âœ… Common Operations on Linked Lists**
| Operation  | Time Complexity |
|------------|---------------|
| Accessing an element | O(n) |
| Searching | O(n) |
| Insertion at head | O(1) |
| Insertion at tail | O(1) |
| Deletion | O(n) |

## **ðŸ“Œ Problem-Solving Techniques**
ðŸ”¹ **Fast & Slow Pointers** â†’ Used for cycle detection  
ðŸ”¹ **Dummy Nodes** â†’ Used to simplify insertions/deletions  
ðŸ”¹ **Recursion** â†’ Used for reversing and merging
