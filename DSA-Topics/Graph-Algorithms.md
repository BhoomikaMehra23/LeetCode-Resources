# ðŸ“‚ Graph Algorithms - Traversals & Shortest Paths  

## **ðŸ“Œ What Are Graph Algorithms?**  
Graphs are powerful data structures used to model **real-world networks** like roads, web pages, and social connections.  
Graph algorithms help in **finding shortest paths, detecting cycles, and solving connectivity problems**.
